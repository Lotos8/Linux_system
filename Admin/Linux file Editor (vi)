A text editor is a program which enables to create and manage date in a Linux file.

We got few Linux editors like:
1. vi(visual editor)
2. ed (Standard line editor)
3. emacs (A full screen editor)
4 vim (advance version of vi)
5. ex (Extended line editor)

I will drive though the vi (visual editor) editor, because it is almost available in almost all Linux distribution.
